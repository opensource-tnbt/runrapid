# Running Tests with DPPD-Prox's rapid 

 1. Update the script (rr.sh) with right filenames, and runtime duration
 2. Update the environment (rapid.env) file - mostly, machines information
 3. Update the tst009.test file. Keep the .cfg file you used to start prox, and add it in this .test file. Update other machine information appropriately.
 4. run prepare_python_env.sh.
 5. run rr.sh.
